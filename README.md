## Description
This project aims to create a weather forecasting application that provides accurate and up-to-date weather information. It addresses the need for reliable weather forecasts by utilizing advanced meteorological data and machine learning algorithms.

## Technology Used
- **Python**: Chosen for its simplicity and extensive libraries for data analysis and machine learning.
- **Flask**: Used to create a lightweight web application framework.
- **OpenWeatherMap API**: Provides real-time weather data.

We chose these technologies because they offer robust solutions for data processing, web development, and accessing weather data.

## Process
1. **Data Collection**: Gathered weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API.
2. **Data Processing**: Cleaned and processed the data using Python.
3. **Model Training**: Trained a machine learning model to predict weather patterns.
4. **Web Development**: Developed a web application using Flask to display the weather forecasts.

The process was designed to ensure accurate data collection, efficient processing, and user-friendly presentation.

## Motivation
This project was initiated to provide users with a reliable source of weather information, helping them plan their activities and stay safe during adverse weather conditions.

## Challenges
During the development of this project, we encountered several challenges, including:
- Integrating the API with our application.
- Ensuring the accuracy of the weather predictions.
- Optimizing the performance of the web application.

## Problem Statement
The project intends to solve the problem of unreliable weather forecasts by providing accurate and timely weather information.

## Intended Use
This project is intended to be used by individuals and organizations who need reliable weather forecasts for planning and safety purposes.

## Credits
We sourced information from the OpenWeatherMap API and would like to give credit to the developers of Flask and Python libraries used in this project.
